# JavaCodeChallenges
I am uploading algorithms that solve various problems that you can find in sites like codility, leetcode, hackerank etc
This algorithms are helpful for thos that wants to practive for code interviews. The reason of this project is not to give away solutions.
There is no point of cheating in a hiring interview cause after you will join a company you will need to use your actual skills everyday.
The reason that this project exists is clearly to educate.

ps I hope I provide the mathematical optimal solution of the problems
